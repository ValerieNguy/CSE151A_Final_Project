### Summary Table of Model Performance

| Model              | Training MSE | Testing MSE  |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Linear Regression**  | 11.18        |  11.79     |
| **Decision Tree**      | 8.80         | 9.68     |
| **Random Forest**      | 5.20         | 5.73     |

### Model 1: Linear Regression
The Linear Regression model achieved an accuracy of 11.17 mean squared error on the training set and 11.79 mean squared error on the test set. Using our method for determining if a prediction was correct or not, on the test data, we got 600294 correct predictions, 318063 false positives, and 216183 false negatives. For visualization, a bar chat of the prediction counts is as follows:

### Model 2: Decision Tree
We decided to pivot away from the Linear Regression model and into a Decision Tree model. This model increased accuracy with a mean squared error of 8.80 on the training set and 9.68 on the test set. Decision Tree had 659422 correct predictions, 274316 false positives, and 200802 false negatives on the test data. These counts are visualized on the bar chart below:

### Model 3: Random Forest
Lastly, the Random Forest model had a mean squared error of 5.20 on the training set and 5.73 on the test set. On the test data, this model had 937495 correct predictions, 126133 false positives, and 68734 false negatives. A bar chart of these counts is displayed below for visualization:

## Discussion

- interpret model results
  - good/bad? believable?
  - what can be extrapolated from results?
- limitations
- fitting graph stuff

### Data Exploration



### Preprocessing



### Model 1: Linear Regression

### Model 3: Random Forest



## Conclusion

- what could have been done differently?
- what could be done moving forward/with more time?
