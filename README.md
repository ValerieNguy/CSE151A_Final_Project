# CSE151A Final Project

## Introduction



## Methods

** summarize/describe methods only, 

### Data Exploration



### Preprocessing



### Model 1: Linear Regression



### Model 2: Decision Tree



### Model 3: Random Forest



## Results

- maybe include a table at the end aggregating/summarizing the results of each model?

### Model 1: Linear Regression

- accuracy
- false positive rate
- graph loss
- amount of null data (?)

### Model 2: Decision Tree

- accuracy
- false positive rate
- graph loss
- amount of null data (?)

### Model 3: Random Forest

- accuracy
- false positive rate
- graph loss
- amount of null data (?)

## Discussion

- interpret model results
  - good/bad? believable?
  - what can be extrapolated from results?
- limitations
- fitting graph stuff

### Data Exploration



### Preprocessing



### Model 1: Linear Regression



### Model 2: Decision Tree



### Model 3: Random Forest



## Conclusion

- what could have been done differently?
- what could be done moving forward/with more time?
