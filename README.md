## Introduction

Our project focuses on predicting taxi fares using the NYC Taxi Fare dataset, a topic chosen due to its real-world relevance and the potential to address a common frustration among riders: unpredictable fare pricing. In rideshare services like Uber and Lyft, fares often fluctuate dramatically, especially in high-demand areas like airports. This inconsistency can make it difficult for users to plan trips or trust the pricing system. By building a predictive model, we aim to reduce this unpredictability and provide riders with better insights into fare expectations.

What makes this project exciting is the opportunity to leverage machine learning to solve a tangible problem. Accurate fare predictions are not only beneficial for riders but also for service providers. For users, a predictive model offers transparency and allows them to determine whether a given fare is reasonable. For providers, the model can inform dynamic pricing algorithms, ensuring fares are competitive yet fair. On a broader scale, improving fare predictability fosters trust in transportation platforms, reduces anxiety around trip costs, and creates a more equitable system for both consumers and drivers. Ultimately, this work highlights how data-driven solutions can transform user experiences and operational strategies in transportation services.
